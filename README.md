<h1>Node.js Contact Form Backend</h1>
<p>
This project sets up a simple Node.js server to handle form submissions from a contact page. It uses Express.js to create a backend server and dotenv for environment configuration, allowing dynamic port selection.

Features
Environment Configuration: The server port is dynamically loaded from the .env file (or defaults to 3001 if not specified).
Server Setup: An Express server listens for incoming requests and processes data.
Contact Form Data Handling: A system to handle and save contact form data from the front-end to a backend service (this could be extended to save data to a database in future iterations).
